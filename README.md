# NLP_FeedForward: In the first part, you plan to use pre-trained vectors like 'glove.6B.50d.txt' for the first layer of the neural network. For the second part, we intend to train the vectors within the network using one-hot encoding for input data. This approach involves leveraging pre-trained word embeddings for the initial layer and then training the network further with one-hot encoding for input data in the subsequent layers.
